### ROUND 1: ASSIGNMENT (SUBMISSON IN GIT HUB)

`Deadline of submission of assignment = Wednesday, 22nd July 2020 @ 12 Noon`

 - No submission after 22nd July 20; 12 Noon will be considered
 - Higher weightage will be given to candidates with early submission {the earliest, the better}

#### Please find below the path to proceed for 1st ROUND of evaluation â€“

- This is an assignment submission round.
- The Assignment is divided into 2 sets - Tasks and Features.
- Candidates are free to implement any single or multiple tasks.
- Features are optional and hence are not mandatory, but implementing it would increase their weighted in
an interview.
- Candidate attempting more tasks and features will obviously take more time than the one implementing
single task, hence the candidates will be shortlisted accordingly, so don't be in a hurry if you feel confident try
implementing more Task and Feature to make your candidature more solid.
- If any copy is found then both candidates will be *disqualified*.


`IMPORTANT NOTE-``

**Candidates must not use any 3rd party library. The assignment will not be evaluated if the 3rd party library is used**

`PART 1 - ASSIGNMENT DETAILS`
- Draw a graph which represents the performance of currencies over a period of time
- The data to plot the graph can be found in `data.json` file in the Github repository
`Github link : https://github.com/winsoft-technologies/2020-interns`



##### Your work is to submit any one or all of the below mentioned tasks

`Applicable to [T1], [T2], and [T3]: Historic data can be found using data.json file`
-  `[T-1]` Plot the graph of INR exchange rate against EUR from 1 Jan 2019 to 31 Jan 2019
- `[T-2]` Plot the graph of INR and GBP exchange rate against EUR from 1 Jan 2019 to 31 Jan 2019.
- `[T-3]` Plot the graph of INR and GBP exchange rate against EUR from 1 Jan 2019 to 31 Jan 2019 and also indicate
the current rate for INR and GBP on the graph itself. (You will get latest rates in the latest-rates.json file)
- `[T-4]` Replace the data.json file with the data from the Rest EndPoint exposed at https://exchangeratesapi.io/
 > - This website will provide you data regarding the exchange rate for various currencies.

 > - You have to use the REST Endpoint exposed by https://exchangeratesapi.io/ to get the required data for the
Assignment.


#### Nice to have features-
- `[F-1]` - Make date range dynamic so that we can select our own date range
- `[F-2]` - Make selection of currency symbol dynamic, so we can choose any currency and the graph should
update accordingly.You can choose any graph style as per your choice but it should represent data in a
meaningful way.


### PART 2- HOW TO DO IT?

- Find the video link which describes the below process:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WHOFewqLn9VZeanQX4VTf6vWyaN9nUWC/view?usp=sharing]

STEPS TO FOLLOW-
1. You must fork this empty Git repository

> Github link: https://github.com/winsoft-technologies/2020-interns

2. Once you forked it then you have to clone your own copy on your machines and can start coding.
3. You have to do periodic commits (no bulk commits), so that we can track the code development process.
4. Once you are done, you have to generate the pull request into the main GitHub repo from where you have
cloned. (https://github.com/winsoft-technologies/2020-interns)
5. While generating pull requests make sure your title describes what you have done....

 `For Example:`

 - A candidate who has implemented only task 1 should have the title

    `[T - 1] - <some short discription>`

 - A candidate who has implemented only task 1 and 2 should have the title

    `[T - 1 - 2] - <some short discription>`

 - A candidate who has implemented only task 1 and Feature 1 should have the title

    `[T - 1 - F - 1] - <some short discription>`

 - A candidate who has implemented only task 1,2 and Feature 1,2 should have the title

    `[T - 1 - 2 - F - 1-2] - <some short discription>`

#### NOTES:
1. Candidate sending first will get higher preference
    > Candidate attempting more tasks and features will obviously take more time than the one implementing single task, hence the candidates will be shortlisted accordingly, so don't be in a hurry if you feel confident try implementing more Task and Feature to make your candidature more solid.

2. Don't commit in bulk, do small commit so that we can see the code development process.

3. `IMPORTANT`

  - In pull request comment add your contact details, so that we can easily reach you
> mention you full name, college name, email id and mobile number.
